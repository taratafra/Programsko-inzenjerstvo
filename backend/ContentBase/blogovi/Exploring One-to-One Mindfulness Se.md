Mindfulness teacher Rosalie Dores shares her insight into one-to-one mindfulness, exploring the benefits of private teaching.
 

Many people find learning mindfulness in a group context transformative. The opportunity to participate in shared learning and exploration with peers allows for the recognition of our common humanity to arise. No-one is alone in their struggles. This coupled with the presence, wisdom and experience of the teacher allows for insight and understanding to arise. People learn about how their minds work and what gets them in, and importantly out, of trouble.

It is not always possible, however, for people to attend a group. Attending a one-to-one mindfulness course provides an equally potent option. During a one-to-one course the participant receives the undivided attention of the teacher. They also attend a course tailored specifically to their learning needs.

For many people the privacy that the one-to-one context provides allows for a deeper level of learning and understanding to emerge. They are less concerned about being vulnerable within a larger group. Having taught in this way for over a decade I have had the privilege of witnessing the power of the one-to-one mindfulness course. Participants deepen in self-understanding, shift unhelpful patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving and develop a sustainable mindfulness practice.
