Breaking Habitual Patterns

Although it may take some time to adjust to initially, taking a retreat in silence gives us the chance to see ourselves and our habitual patterns more clearly.

Mindfulness teacher Christiane Kerr highlights;

 

“Silence can be challenging for many of us when we first start to observe it, but over time it becomes a welcome and nourishing refuge.

Being in silence allows our practice to deepen and helps us recognise our habitual thought patterns.”

 

For example, you might notice that you get very self-conscious at meal times, which might lead to urges to eat more or less than usual. On retreat, there’s no distracting ourselves in such uncomfortable moments by checking our phones or chatting. Instead, we have the opportunity to cultivate awareness of our patterns, and meet them with self-compassion.
