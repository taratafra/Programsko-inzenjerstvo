Training Our Muscle of Attention

On retreat, we spend a large amount of our time in formal meditation, and the rest of our waking time in informal practice. This means we are exercising our muscle of attention much more than we would usually do. This presents a wonderful opportunity for us to have deep insights, and this turning inwards to connect with ourselves and our inner wisdom can bring new perspectives that leave us feeling refreshed and renewed.

Most retreat attendees notice a significant difference in their ability to meet everyday challenges with more ease when returning back home.

For those new to meditation or a silent meditation retreat, the idea might seem quite daunting and scary, or even just really unappealing. But by placing ourselves in this unique environment, we can truly spend time with ourselves, have space for reflection and practice living in the present moment.

And just because it’s silent, it doesn’t mean that you can’t talk to one of the teachers or support staff if you need to. There is often dedicated time for discussion with the teacher in groups during the retreat. In other words, the silence isn’t there as a test of stamina, but rather a way to observe your habitual patterns and thoughts. It is only through this awareness that we gain a platform to change and grow.

 

All eight-week courses include a retreat day. For those that have completed a course, we run regular retreat days to help reconnect with practice.
