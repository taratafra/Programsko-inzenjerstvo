Gaining Guidance & Wisdom

As well as teaching one-to-one mindfulness, I have received the wise counsel of various teachers over my 30+ years of practice. Without the benefit of their experience and guidance my practice would have stagnated. It sounds obvious, but I can’t see, what I can’t see, I can’t know what I don’t know.

My teachers have offered me the benefit of their many years of practice. I have learnt from their hard earned wisdom derived from personal struggles and triumphs. I have also felt their deep kindness and compassion derived from being humbled by life over and over again.

Having the benefit of their perspectives and presence has allowed me to recognise when I was caught in painful patterns of behaviour. Receiving their invaluable practice guidance has allowed me to relate to my experience in a way that reduces stress rather than increases it. My gifts and capacities have also been supported to flourish.
