“On retreat, we nourish the most important relationship that we have - the relationship with ourselves.”
 

-- SARAH POWERS
 

This year, as well as taking a traditional holiday, consider taking a break to nourish your body and mind on a restorative retreat day. 

A retreat takes us away from the distractions of daily life. It might include the surroundings of nature and can be a wonderful opportunity to slow down, take a digital detox and truely experience time for ourselves.

And there are many ways in which a retreat can be beneficial...

 

Space To Grow

Carving out the time to fully dedicate ourselves to an extended period of mindfulness away from everyday life is an excellent opportunity to deepen and rejuvenate our practice.

Mindfulness teacher James Milford explains;

 

“A retreat removes the daily responsibilities and technological distractions, meaning that you have more time and space in which to dedicate yourself to sitting.

This is essential as practice can grow stale and tick-box like if all we ever do is try and fit it into an existing schedule.”
