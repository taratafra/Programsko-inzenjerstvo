Finally, Do You Have Any Top Journaling or Mindfulness Tips?

My top tips for both mindfulness and mindfulness journaling are:

Let go of any effort to achieve something or get a specific outcome   
Let go of any guilt of not practising enough 
Consider group meditation to gather momentum for your own practice
