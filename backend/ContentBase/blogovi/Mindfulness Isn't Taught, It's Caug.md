Mindfulness Isn't Taught, It's Caught

My experience of being ‘held’ in this way has been beneficial to me both personally and professionally. I’ve heard it said, that ‘mindfulness isn’t taught, it’s caught’. This rings true for me. The skills that I bring to my work with people; deep listening, feeding back, checking my understanding, inviting and guiding experiential exploration is informed by my experiences of being supported by other, ‘elders’ along the way.

If you want to climb a mountain, I imagine you would employ an experienced mountain climber, who knows the landscapes, it’s opportunities and pitfalls. So it is with engaging in one-to-one work with a meditation teacher. You need an experienced guide.
